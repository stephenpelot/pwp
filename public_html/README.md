## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good job but you're going to need some improvement. Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal well thought out. This will defintely help you on the next part of the design process. The persona could use work at the end. For future reference, the content you used for 'use case' is a better example of a 'user story'. Remember to follow directions, this part of the project didn't ask for a 'use case'. Code needs some clean up. The <title> and <meta> tags should be between the <head> tag. Everything else should be between the body tags. Please refer to documentation on the DOM via https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction. This may be tedious but they are essential to keeping clean code. Don't forget to commit and push often!!! This will become a vital when it comes to capstone projects and working with partners. Please make the revisions ASAP. Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier II.
